1,"The following text is from Emilia Pardo-Bazan's 1898 short story ""First Love:"" But one day-I remember as well as if it were today-in the corner of the top drawer, and lying on some collars of old lace, I saw something gold glittering-I put in my hand, unwittingly crumpled the lace, and drew out a portrait, an ivory miniature, about three inches long, in a frame of gold. I was struck at first sight. A sunbeam streamed through the window and fell upon the alluring form, which seemed to wish to step out of its dark background and come towards me.

2,"In her 1917 “Address to the United States Congress,” Carrie Chapman Catts, president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, urged Congress to women's grievances by immediately putting forward legislation granting women the right to vote. Citing a history of delays, political tricks, and dishonesty, Catts warned legislators that once women could vote, they would remember those who opposed them with suspicion. She argued that this issue was so important that, despite having to defend themselves in World War I, some of America's allies in that war had already passed legislation expanding the right to vote to women.

5,"Ludonarrative dissonance is a term used in the study and design of video game. It refers to an the narrative of a game’s story, told through cut-scenes or dialogue, and the narrative created by the gameplay. For example, the story might ostensibly be about a thief struggling with the morality of stealing to provide for her family. However, if the fun of gameplay is centered on stealth, sneaking past guards to rob a safe or steal famous artwork, then a clash is created between what the story and gameplay are saying about theft.

6,"The following text is from Kate Chopin’s 1894 short story, ''A Respectable Woman.” Mrs. Baroda was a little provoked to learn that her husband expected his friend, Gouvernail, up to spend a week or two on the plantation... This was a man she had heard much of but never seen. He had been her husband’s college friend; was now a journalist, and in no sense a society man or “a man about town,” which were, perhaps, some of the reasons she had never met him. But she had unconsciously formed an image of him in her mind. She pictured him tall, slim, cynical; with eyeglasses, and his hands in his pockets; and she did not like him. Gouvernail was slim enough, but he wasn't very tall nor very cynical; neither did he wear eyeglasses nor carry his hands in his pockets. And she rather liked him when he first presented himself. But why she liked him she could not explain satisfactorily to herself when she partly attempted to do so. Which choice best states the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?

7,"The following text is from A. A. Milne's 1922 novel The Red House Mystery. It was understood - and this, anyhow, on Mark's own authority - that his father had been a country clergyman. It was said that, as a boy, Mark had attracted the notice, and patronage, of some rich old spinster of the neighborhood, who had paid for his education, both at school and university. At about the time when he was coming down from Cambridge, his father had died; leaving behind him a few debts, as a warning to his family, and a reputation for short sermons, as an example to his successor. Neither warning nor example seems to have been effective. Mark went to London, with an allowance from his patron, and (it is generally agreed) made acquaintance with the moneylenders. He was supposed, by his patron and any others who inquired, to be ""writing""; but what he wrote, other than letters asking for more time to pay, has never been discovered.

10,"Text 1 Earth shares many characteristics with Venus, its closest planetary neighbor. However, Earth enjoys a wet, temperate climate while it appears that all the water once present on Venus has boiled away in its fierce heat. Because the planets are otherwise so similar, experts believe that a catastrophic event caused Venus to lose its water. Text 2 Michael Way, Richard Ernst, and Jeffery Scargle posit that volcanic activity on Earth could cause the planet to overheat and become uninhabitable. They cite the massive amounts of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by volcanic activity that usually cause a period of hotter temperatures followed by a return to Earth's normal, cooler temperature. But, it is possible that several large volcanic events occurring in rapid succession could raise temperatures high enough that Earth would be unable to recover.

Bycatch are thrown back into the ocean, but not before some animals are injured, sometimes fatally. Paul Wade and team describe bycatch as the largest human contributor to marine species decline and insist that the commercial fishing industry work to reduce bycatch. Text 2 Philip Doherty and colleagues are testing a device that is attached just above a fishhook and sends an electrical pulse into the hook. The researchers placed the device on half of the hooks deployed by a commercial fishing ship and compared the bycatch found on these hooks to those without.

12,"Text 1 Some literary critics argue that Gustave Flaubert's 1856 novel Madame Bovary has a strange and subversive theme that undermines its own medium: in short, they say that Flaubert's masterpiece of fiction is a cautionary tale about the dangers of reading novels. As evidence, they point to its unsympathetic protagonist, Emma Bovary, who lives in her books and romanticizes the simplest aspects of daily life as well as her relationships, ultimately becoming entirely dissatisfied with real life. Text 2 Flaubert's Madame Bovary was not meant to be a criticism of fiction itself, but a warning against allowing suggestible people like Emma to have access to novels. It is the other characters' unwillingness to check Emma's literary passions (and even their ignorance of the existence of such a problem) that leads to the disintegration of the Bovary household.

13,"Cement is needed to make concrete, one of the most important building materials used throughout the world, but the carbon dioxide released by its manufacture generates about 8% of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions. To make concrete by a process that consumes carbon dioxide, rather than produces it, a Colorado company uses cyanobacteria, a bacteria capable of photosynthesis. The bacteria are raised in water, under lights, with the carbon dioxide needed for photosynthesis pumped in. The bacteria generate tiny crystals of calcium carbonate, the main component of limestone, which is then blended with sand or another aggregate to make ""bioconcrete.""

14,"An artificial intelligence (AI) computer program has established its dominance over most human players in one of the most complex online games. Computers have previously bested masters of backgammon, chess, and go, but unlike these games, more complex online games require verbal and relationship skills: players bargain, cooperate, form alliances, and may break them. It is this added dimension of communication, negotiation, and subterfuge that makes large online games so complex and unpredictable.

In former times, those severe places where the discipline of the prison delivers the convict into his own hands, were composed of four stone walls, a stone ceiling, a flagged pavement, a camp bed, a grated window, and a door lined with iron. They were called dungeons; but the dungeon was judged to be too terrible. Nowadays they are composed of an iron door, a grated window, a camp bed, a flagged pavement, four stone walls, and a stone ceiling, and are called chambers of punishment.

17,"The following text is adapted from Thucydides' 5th century B.C.E. work History of the Peloponnesianwar. During the war, Athens and Sparta each lead an alliance of city-states. Thucydides describes the war's impact on Corcyra, a neutral city-state. In peace there would have been neither the pretext nor the wish to make such an invitation; but in war, with an alliance always at the command of either political faction for the hurt of their adversaries and their own corresponding advantage, opportunities for bringing in the foreigner were never wanting to the revolutionary partiesWords had to change their ordinary meaning and to take that which was now given them. Reckless audacity came to be considered the courage of a loyal ally; prudent hesitation, specious cowardice; moderation was held to be a cloak for unmanliness; ability to see all sides of a question, inaptness to act on any.

18,"Scientists previously assumed that insects, unlike some mammals and birds, do not engage in play — actions that have no known survival purpose but rather seem motivated by pleasure. However, researchers from Queen Mary University of London studied play in bees, hypothesizing that the insects will actively seek out the opportunity to engage in play. In one test, bees could choose to proceed directly to food or to divert to spaces containing miniature wooden balls. The bees rolled the balls repeatedly — one bee doing so over a hundred times. This result caused the researchers to conclude that the bees were indeed playing, as they apparently obtained pleasure from rolling the balls. In a second test, bees were placed in an enclosure with two differently colored spaces; only one of the spaces had wooden balls. The bees were later given the opportunity to choose to enter one of the two differently-colored spaces. Which finding from the second test, if true, would most strongly support the researchers' hypothesis? Please give 1 answer.",Bees that initially engaged in high amounts of ball rolling typically decreased their ball-rolling activity over the course of the tests.,The vast majority of bees tended to bypass the opportunity to roll balls in order to access food more quickly.,The bees showed a preference for the space that was the same color as the one previously containing balls.,"The bees preferred spaces that were darker colors, regardless of whether darker spaces previously contained balls.",C,Textual Command of Evidence ,Hard,,Information and Ideas

23,"One difficulty facing palaeoarchaeologists, researchers who study ancient human remains, is determining accurate dates for the hominid fossils they analyze. Scientific dating methods fall into two broad categories: relative and absolute. Relative dating approximates date ranges based on where a fossil is located in relation to other fossils. For instance, stratigraphy, a type of relative dating, relies on the principle that lower sedimentary layers are older than higher ones. Absolute dating uses techniques such as radiometric dating, which measures the decay of radioactive materials in a fossil. Palaeoarchaeologists today rely on a combination of these methods and claim that subsequent analyses over time can sometimes determine that hominid fossils are older than was previously thought.
