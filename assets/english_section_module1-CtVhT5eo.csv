3,"Since the 1950s, scientists have known that rapid eye movement, or REM, occurs when someone is sleeping. Previous studies attempting to determine the meaning of these eye movements have been unsuccessful in part because these studies relied on human subjects recalling the content of their dreams. A recent study by physiologists Yuta Senzai and Massimo Scanziani has avoided this issue by studying dreaming mice instead. Their results suggest that REM is correlated to changes in direction during the dream.
Which choice best describes the function of the second sentence in the overall structure of the text?",It names a problem in the approach taken by Senzai and Scanziani.,It introduces the difficulty that the study by Senzai and Scanziani was designed to bypass.,It presents the findings of studies done prior to the study by Senzai and Scanziani.,It clarifies how others studying REM sleep interpret the study by Senzai and Scanziani.,B,
4,"Electroreception is the ability of an animal to sense the flow of electricity around it by using specialized organs known as electroreceptors. Most species known to use electroreception are fish, including many sharks, elephant fishes, and eels. However. electroreception is not limited to fish. Monotremes, a group of mammals that includes the platypus and some echidnas, have electroreceptors on or near their mouths to help locate prey. There is also some evidence that bees can detect static electricity on flowers. Which choice best describes the function of the third sentence in the overall structure of the text?",It generalizes the phenomenon discussed beyond fishes.,It offers another explanation of electroreception that is different from the explanation of how electroreception is used by fishes.,It provides more examples of animals with electroreception.,It explains how electroreception evolved in monotremes and bees.,A,
5,"Text 1
An animal is said to have a theory of mind when it is able to act according to the mental states of other individuals. Psychologists David Premack and Guy Woodruff studied whether chimpanzees have such a theory of mind. They showed videos of human actors struggling with various problems. The chimpanzees were able to select photographs that showed the best tool to solve each actor’s problem.
Text 2
Biologist Daniel J. Povinelli and psychologists Kurt E. Nelson and Sarah T. Boysen have argued that previous research into whether chimpanzees have a theory of mind have not adequately addressed alternative explanations for the chimpanzees’ behaviors. Specifically, it may be the case that chimpanzees are following learned behaviors in a known environment, rather than applying a theory of mind in a novel situation.
Based on the texts, how would Povinelli, Nelson, and Boysen (Text 2) most likely respond to Premack and Woodruff (Text 1)?","They would argue that nonhuman primates other than chimpanzees, such as baboons and gorillas, may also have a theory of mind.",They would argue that the chimpanzees would be able to solve the problems themselves without referencing the photographs by struggling with the situation themselves and eventually determining the correct solution,They would encourage Premack and Woodruff to show the same videos and photographs to other nonhuman primates and compare the other nonhuman primates’ reactions to the chimpanzees’ reactions.,"They would suggest that placing the chimpanzee subjects in novel environments, such as rooms distinct from the chimpanzees’ regular enclosures, may help better ascertain whether chimpanzees have a theory of mind",D,
6,"The following text is from Oscar Wilde’s 1890 novel The Picture of
Dorian Gray. Dorian is seeing his portrait, painted by Basil Hallward, for the first time.
Dorian made no answer, but passed listlessly in front of his picture and turned towards it. When he saw it he drew back, and his cheeks flushed for a moment with pleasure. A look of joy came into his eyes, as if he had recognized himself for the first time.

7,"The following text is from Frederick Marryat’s 1847 novel The Children of the New Forest.
The old forester lay awake the whole of this night, reflecting how he should act relative to the children; he felt the great responsibility that he had incurred, and was alarmed when he considered what might be the consequences if his days were shortened. What would become of them—living in so sequestered a spot that few knew even of its existence—totally shut out from the world, and left to their own resources?

In hearts like thine ne’er may I hold a place
Till I renounce all sense, all shame, all grace—
That seat,—like seats, the bane of Freedom’s realm,

Is basely purchased, not with gold alone;
Add Conscience, too, this bargain is your own— ‘Tis thine to offer with corrupting art
The rotten borough of the human heart.

9,"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by the body’s response to an infection. These infections are typically bacterial but may be fungal, parasitic, or viral. The body’s response to these infections leads to increased inflammation and organ damage. This damage, in turn, results in a weakened immune system, which increases the likelihood of reinfection. In a recent study, a team of doctors and pharmacologists led by Shubham Soni claims that administering ketone esters can reduce inflammation and immune system weakening caused by sepsis.
Which finding from the team led by Soni, if true, would most directly support its claim?",Patients with sepsis who were administered ketone esters had fewer signs of inflammation and less organ damage than those administered standard antibiotics.,"When administered, ketone esters are known to increase blood ketone levels, which in turn are a source of energy for the brain.",Both those patients administered ketone esters and those administered standard antibiotics did not have reduced inflammation when treated with medication intended to reduce fever.,Those sepsis patients administered ketone esters had reduced inflammation but greater organ damage than those administered standard antibiotics,A,
10,"Horses have been domesticated for thousands of years. Therefore, they show great sensitivity to the emotions of humans. Biologist Oceane Liehrmann from the University of Turku, Finland, led a team of researchers in a study of horses to determine the effect of the number of handlers (either only one person or multiple people) on the horses’ responses to a novel object. The researchers determined that horses with only one handler were less reluctant to interact with the novel object than were horses with multiple handlers. For example, 45% of horses with only one handler had no reluctance when interacting with a novel object while 	.

12,"Fatty liver disease (FLD) occurs when excess fat builds up in the liver. While there are often few or no symptoms of FLD, if left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer. Because FLD is often asymptomatic, doctors and researchers rely on indicators such as steatosis (retention of fat in the liver), fibrosis (scarring), blood glucose (sugar), serum insulin, and insulin resistance to measure and track the development of FLD. A group of researchers led by radiologist Hamid Reza Talari hypothesized that those who take vitamin B12 would experience improvements in fibrosis and insulin resistance when compared to a control group over the same time period.
Which choice best describes data from the table that support the researchers’ hypothesis?",Those in the control group had decreases in their steatosis values and fasting blood glucose but had increases in fibrosis values and HOMA-IR.,"Those in the vitamin B12 group had decreases in fibrosis values and HOMA-IR levels, whereas those in the control group had increases in these same values",Both those in the vitamin B12 group and the control group had decreases in their steatosis values.,"Those in the control group had a decrease in their fasting blood glucose, but those in the vitamin B12 group had an increase in their fasting blood glucose.",B,

14,"Neurons respond to stimuli from sensory organs or other neurons. Learning occurs when neurons change how they respond to stimuli based on previous experience, which is a property of memory.

•	Two examples of numeral systems from history are Babylonian cuneiform numerals and Roman numerals.
•	The Babylonian cuneiform numeral system is a base-60 system and lacks a zero digit.
•	It’s a positional numeral system in which the position of a digit affects its value.
