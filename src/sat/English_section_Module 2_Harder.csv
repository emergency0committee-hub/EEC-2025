9,"The following text is adapted from Charles Dickens’s 1859 novel A Tale of Two Cities. Mr. Lorry, traveling to France on business, is delivering some news to Miss Manette, the daughter of one of his friends “Miss Manette, I am a man of business. I have a business charge to acquit myself of. In your reception of it, don’t heed me any more than if I was a speaking machine—truly, I am not much else. I will, with your leave, relate to you, miss, the story of one of our customers.”He seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated, when he added, in a hurry, “Yes, customers; in the banking business we usually call our connection our customers.

10,"Nisga’a poet Jordan Abel addresses the experiences of Indigenous people as European settlers and their descendants took over North America. Abel’s first book of poetry, The Place of Scraps (2014), uses Totem Poles, a 1929 book by anthropologist Marius Barbeau, as source material.

11,"In Japan, adults may be legally adopted into a family. The practice may have started as early as the 13th century CE, but widespread adult adoption dates from the Tokugawa shogunate, a military government which began around 1600 CE. During this time, members of the ruling class would adopt competent adult males, who would then ensure that the family’s political and business interests would be sustained. While adult adoption remains a way for individuals to improve their economic and social status, the practice has its detractors as well, with some researchers arguing that it can lead to issues with the adoptee developing a firm sense of identity in his or her new environment.Which of the following best illustrates the researcher’s claim?","Adult adoptees are entitled to an inheritance from their adoptive families, strengthening the ties between them, which further encourages the adult adoptee to work to enhance the new family’s prosperity.","While most adult adoptees typically report improved financial status after adoption, many of those same adoptees also experience higher-than-normal rates of depression and anxiety.","Elsewhere in East Asia, such as in China and Korea, families have a traditional obligation to adopt blood relatives who lack more closely-related living kin, but adoptions in Japan are almost exclusively between those with no blood relations.",Families with ancestors who were adult adoptees do not distinguish between those ancestors who were members of the family by birth and those who were adopted into the family.,B,
12,"Neurologists have hypothesized that tau protein, the mutation of which is known to cause Alzheimer’s disease, is key to controlling glutamate receptors, which are involved in the production of memories.

13,"From 1634 to 1637 CE, tulips in the Dutch Republic sold for extraordinarily high prices, sometimes as much as 10 times the annual wage of a skilled worker, in a phenomenon known as tulip mania. Some economists, such as Charles Kindleberger, argue that tulip mania was the first speculative bubble in history, during which the prices of a commodity (in this case tulip bulbs) do not follow the typical rules of economics. Others, such as Peter Garber, believe that tulip mania is explainable by fundamental economic concepts such as supply and demand. Which finding, if true, would most directly support Garber’s argument?","Tulips during this period were very rare, and demand for tulips was fueled in part by the ability to reproduce and sell bulbs, enabling some purchasers to make profits.","Some common bulbs, such as the Witte Croonen bulb, saw price increases as dramatic as those of rare bulbs.",The prices of tulip bulbs were much higher than could be supported by the banking system in place in 17th century Europe.,The tulip mania led to an increase of the supply of gold coins in the Dutch Republic.,A,
14,"The use of pesticides in agriculture poses risks to both humans and the environment, so finding alternative methods of pest control is an important area of research. The use of ants to control pests in China goes back to at least the 4th century CE, and farmers in places such as Kenya, Ghana, and Canada have also used ants to control various organisms. Entomologist Diego Anjos and others have identified several positive effects (services) of ants, such as reducing both the abundance of non-honeydew-producing species and plant damage. However, ants also have negative effects, such as increasing the abundance of honeydew-producing species and spreading pathogens, suggesting that Which choice most logically completes the text?",ants may have unintended environmental consequences when used to control pests in certain circumstances.,other species may also be effective in providing services to farmers.,ants as pest control provide numerous services without serious ramifications.,scientists do not yet know whether using ants to control organisms is a net positive in any situation.,B,
15,"Among many animals, such as mice, fruit flies, and humans, each odor that an animal can smell is detected by a particular kind of sensory neuron that has a particular kind of receptor; eliminating that receptor through illness or genetic manipulation results in the inability to smell that odor. A team led by neurobiologist Margo Herre tested whether mosquitoes modified to lack the receptor for smelling blood would be unable to find humans. These mosquitoes were still able to find humans, suggesting that Which choice most logically completes the text?",mosquitoes without damage to their odor receptors are more capable of finding humans than those with damage,"like mice, fruit flies, and humans, individual mosquitoes with damage to particular receptors will be unable to detect certain odors","researchers cannot assume that mosquitoes have the same correlation between receptors and the ability to sense certain odors that mice, fruit flies, and humans have",researchers can assume that interfering with mosquitoes’ odor receptors is a potential way to prevent mosquitoes from feeding on humans.,C,
16,"The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was an agreement among the United States, Canada, and Mexico that was in effect between 1994 and 2020.

This suggests that, between 1994 and 2020, Which choice most logically completes the text?",the number of manufacturing jobs in Mexico increased by a greater amount than the combined decreases in the United States and Canada.,NAFTA made it more difficult for manufacturers to establish factories in the United States and Canada.,the cost of manufacturing goods in the area covered by NAFTA decreased.,"complex goods, such as automobiles and electronics, were increasingly manufactured in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.",A,
