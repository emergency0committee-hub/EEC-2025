3,"Since the 1950s, scientists have known that rapid eye movement, or REM, occurs when someone is sleeping. Previous studies attempting to determine the meaning of these eye movements have been unsuccessful in part because these studies relied on human subjects recalling the content of their dreams. A recent study by physiologists Yuta Senzai and Massimo Scanziani has avoided this issue by studying dreaming mice instead. Their results suggest that REM is correlated to changes in direction during the dream.

4,"Electroreception is the ability of an animal to sense the flow of electricity around it by using specialized organs known as electroreceptors. Most species known to use electroreception are fish, including many sharks, elephant fishes, and eels. However. electroreception is not limited to fish.

There is also some evidence that bees can detect static electricity on flowers. Which choice best describes the function of the third sentence in the overall structure of the text?",It generalizes the phenomenon discussed beyond fishes.,It offers another explanation of electroreception that is different from the explanation of how electroreception is used by fishes.,It provides more examples of animals with electroreception.,It explains how electroreception evolved in monotremes and bees.,A,
5,"Text 1
An animal is said to have a theory of mind when it is able to act according to the mental states of other individuals. Psychologists David Premack and Guy Woodruff studied whether chimpanzees have such a theory of mind. They showed videos of human actors struggling with various problems. The chimpanzees were able to select photographs that showed the best tool to solve each actor’s problem.
Text 2
Biologist Daniel J. Povinelli and psychologists Kurt E. Nelson and Sarah T. Boysen have argued that previous research into whether chimpanzees have a theory of mind have not adequately addressed alternative explanations for the chimpanzees’ behaviors. Specifically, it may be the case that chimpanzees are following learned behaviors in a known environment, rather than applying a theory of mind in a novel situation.
Based on the texts, how would Povinelli, Nelson, and Boysen (Text 2) most likely respond to Premack and Woodruff (Text 1)?",,,,,D,
6,"The following text is from Oscar Wilde’s 1890 novel The Picture of
Dorian Gray. Dorian is seeing his portrait, painted by Basil Hallward, for the first time.
Dorian made no answer, but passed listlessly in front of his picture and turned towards it. When he saw it he drew back, and his cheeks flushed for a moment with pleasure. A look of joy came into his eyes, as if he had recognized himself for the first time. He stood there motionless and in wonder, dimly conscious that Hallward was speaking to him, but not catching the meaning of his words. The sense of his own beauty came on him like a revelation.

8,"The following text is Baron George Gordon Byron’s poem “Answer to  	’s Professions of Affection,” written around 1814. The poem is addressed to an unknown person.
In hearts like thine ne’er may I hold a place
Till I renounce all sense, all shame, all grace—
That seat,—like seats, the bane of Freedom’s realm,
But dear to those presiding at the helm—
Is basely purchased, not with gold alone;
Add Conscience, too, this bargain is your own— ‘Tis thine to offer with corrupting art
The rotten borough of the human heart.

9,"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by the body’s response to an infection. These infections are typically bacterial but may be fungal, parasitic, or viral. The body’s response to these infections leads to increased inflammation and organ damage. This damage, in turn, results in a weakened immune system, which increases the likelihood of reinfection. In a recent study, a team of doctors and pharmacologists led by Shubham Soni claims that administering ketone esters can reduce inflammation and immune system weakening caused by sepsis.
Which finding from the team led by Soni, if true, would most directly support its claim?",,,,,A,
10,"Horses have been domesticated for thousands of years. Therefore, they show great sensitivity to the emotions of humans.

The researchers determined that horses with only one handler were less reluctant to interact with the novel object than were horses with multiple handlers. For example, 45% of horses with only one handler had no reluctance when interacting with a novel object while 	.

12,"Fatty liver disease (FLD) occurs when excess fat builds up in the liver. While there are often few or no symptoms of FLD, if left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer. Because FLD is often asymptomatic, doctors and researchers rely on indicators such as steatosis (retention of fat in the liver), fibrosis (scarring), blood glucose (sugar), serum insulin, and insulin resistance to measure and track the development of FLD. A group of researchers led by radiologist Hamid Reza Talari hypothesized that those who take vitamin B12 would experience improvements in fibrosis and insulin resistance when compared to a control group over the same time period.
Which choice best describes data from the table that support the researchers’ hypothesis?",,,,,B,
13,"The air pollution produced in an area is only one factor in that area’s air quality.

14,"Neurons respond to stimuli from sensory organs or other neurons. Learning occurs when neurons change how they respond to stimuli based on previous experience, which is a property of memory.
